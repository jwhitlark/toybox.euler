"When asked to prove something true or false, people tend to focus on
confirming the rule rather than falsifying it. This is why they turn
over the 8 card, to confirm the rule by observing a vowel on the other
side, and the A card, to find the confirming even number. But if they
thought scientifically, they would look for a way to falsify the
ruleâ€”a thought pattern that would immediately suggest the relevance of
the 5 card (which might contain a disconfirming vowel on the
back). Seeking falsifying evidence is a crucial component of
scientific thinking. But for most people, this bit of mindware must be
taught until it becomes second nature."
